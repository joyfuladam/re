# Song-by-Song Master Revenue Share Agreement Template

**SONG-BY-SONG MASTER REVENUE SHARE AGREEMENT**

This Agreement is made effective as of {{effective_date}} ("Effective Date"), between **River and Ember, LLC** ("Label"), a {{label_state}} limited liability company with principal place of business at {{label_address}}, and **{{artist_full_name}}**, an individual residing at {% if artist_address %}{{artist_address}}{% else %}<span style="color: red;">[Artist address not provided]</span>{% endif %} ("Artist").

**RECITALS**  
Label and Artist desire to collaborate on a per-song basis for the sound recording titled "{{song_title}}" (the "Recording"). This Agreement is limited to this specific song and does not create an exclusive or long-term relationship, preserving Artist's freedom to pursue other opportunities.

**AGREEMENT**

1. **Services & Grant of Rights**  
   Artist shall provide lead performance and creative input for the Recording. Artist hereby grants and assigns to Label all right, title, and interest in and to the master sound recording(s) of the Recording (the "Master"), including all worldwide copyright and other proprietary rights therein. Artist further grants Label perpetual, worldwide rights to exploit, distribute, promote, and create derivative works from the Master (including alternative versions), and to use Artist's name, likeness, voice, and performance in connection therewith. Artist acknowledges that this assignment constitutes full transfer of ownership of the Master to Label, and Artist shall have no ownership interest therein.

2. **Compensation - Master Revenue Share**  
   In full consideration for Artist's services and the assignment of Master rights, Label shall pay Artist {{artist_share_percentage}}% of Net Receipts from digital revenue streams (streaming and downloads). "Net Receipts" means all monies actually received by Label from any source attributable to the digital exploitation of the Master (including streaming and downloads), less any third-party fees, taxes, returns, or customary deductions.  
   Artist shall **not** be entitled to any revenue from the Master outside of Net Receipts, including but not limited to synchronization licenses, physical sales, live performance fees, direct licensing, or any other exploitation. Label retains 100% of such revenue to fund future ministry projects and Label operations.

3. **Alternative Versions**  
   Label may, at its sole discretion and expense, create, record, and release alternative versions of the Recording (including but not limited to acoustic, instrumental, live, radio edits, or featured artist collaborations) to enhance visibility, congregational adoption, church usage (e.g., CCLI), and revenue potential. All such versions shall be owned exclusively by Label. Alternative versions will be subject to separate contracts specific to those arrangements, and shall not be subject to the revenue share terms of this Agreement. Label will consult with Artist on creative decisions where practicable and provide appropriate credit.

4. **Publishing**  
   Publishing rights for the underlying musical composition(s) are governed by separate Song-by-Song Publishing Assignment Agreement (if applicable). Artist retains full control of publishing rights in non-Label songs. This Agreement pertains solely to Master rights and revenues.

5. **Accounting & Payment**  
   Label shall provide quarterly accounting statements detailing Net Receipts (if exceeding $25 threshold) and pay Artist's share within 30 days thereafter. Artist may audit Label's relevant records once per year upon reasonable notice, at Artist's expense.

6. **Conduct Standards**  
   Artist agrees to conduct themselves, both publicly and privately, in a manner consistent with biblical Christian principles during the term of this Agreement and in connection with promotion of the Recording. Artist understands that any public conduct reasonably deemed by Label to be materially inconsistent with such principles may impact Label's willingness to collaborate on future projects, though it shall not affect Label's perpetual ownership of the Master or rights hereunder.

7. **Warranties & Representations**  
   Artist warrants and represents that: (i) Artist has full right and authority to grant the rights herein; (ii) the performance is original and does not infringe third-party rights; and (iii) Artist will not make any claims inconsistent with Label's ownership of the Master.

8. **Governing Law**  
   This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of {{governing_state}}, without regard to conflict of laws principles. Any disputes shall be resolved exclusively in the courts of {{governing_state}}.

9. **Entire Agreement**  
   This constitutes the entire understanding between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements. No modifications except in writing signed by both parties.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the Effective Date.
